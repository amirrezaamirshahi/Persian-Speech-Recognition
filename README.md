A comprehensive Persian speech recognition system focused on **keyword spotting** in continuous speech using **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)** for feature extraction and **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)** for alignment and classification. This project processes isolated Persian words and continuous sentences, enabling accurate detection of keywords like "سلام" (Salam), "بله" (Bale), and "خداحافظ" (Khodahafez).

The system achieves high accuracy on a custom dataset of Persian audio recordings, demonstrating robustness to variations in speaking rate and minor noise. Ideal for applications like voice assistants, transcription tools, or real-time keyword monitoring in Farsi conversations.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end pipeline for Persian speech recognition:
- **Audio Preprocessing**: Resampling, noise filtering, and silence trimming.
- **Feature Extraction**: MFCC with delta and delta-delta coefficients for robust representation.
- **Alignment & Classification**: DTW for comparing sequences, handling temporal variations.
- **Keyword Spotting**: Subsequence DTW to detect keywords in long-form continuous speech.
- **Evaluation**: Confusion matrices, accuracy metrics, and visualizations.

Key innovations:
- Fixed-length normalization of features via interpolation.
- Multi-metric DTW (Euclidean, Manhattan, Cosine, Correlation).
- 60/40 train-test split for isolated word recognition.
- Manual annotation integration for supervised keyword detection.

The system was tested on a dataset of ~100 isolated word utterances and 20+ continuous sentences, achieving **~85% overall accuracy** on isolated words and **~70% precision** in keyword spotting.

## 🚀 Features

- **Isolated Word Recognition**: Train and test on words like Salam, Bale, Kheir, Motshakeram, BesiarAali, Khodahafez.
- **Continuous Speech Processing**: Handle full sentences with automatic keyword extraction.
- **Visualization Tools**: Waveforms, FFT spectra, MFCC spectrograms, and DTW cost matrices.
- **Modular Design**: Easy-to-extend classes for DTWAnalyzer, FeatureExtractor, and ASR system.
- **Evaluation Suite**: Per-word accuracy, confusion matrices, and confidence scoring.
- **GUI Prototype**: Basic interface for audio annotation (under development).

## 🔧 Usage

### 1. Run the Pipeline
Execute notebooks in order via Jupyter:
```
jupyter notebook
```
- Start with `preprocess_audio.ipynb` to clean isolated words.
- Proceed to `DTW_ASR.ipynb` for training the recognizer.
- For continuous speech: `preprocess_audio_continuous_speech.ipynb` → `SubsequenceDTW.ipynb`.

### 2. Train the ASR Model
```python
# In DTW_ASR.ipynb
from dtw_asr import DTWBasedASR  # Assuming modularized code

asr = DTWBasedASR()
asr.train(training_data)  # Dict of word: [file_paths]
asr.save_model('model_res/dtw_model.pkl')
```

### 3. Keyword Spotting Example
```python
# In SubsequenceDTW.ipynb
detector = SubsequenceDTWKeywordDetector()
result = detector.detect_keywords('sentence_01.npy', keywords=['Salam', 'Bale'], threshold=40.0)
print(result['keywords'])  # [{'word': 'سلام', 'start_time': 0.5, 'end_time': 1.2}, ...]
```

### 4. Annotation Tool
Use `annotation.ipynb` for manual labeling:
```python
annotator = AudioAnnotator('path/to/audio.wav', 'Full sentence text')
annotator.add_annotation('سلام', 0.2, 0.8)
annotator.save_annotations('data/annotations/file.json')
```

### 5. Evaluation
- **Accuracy**: Run `DTW_ASR.ipynb` for per-word and overall metrics.
- **Visualize**: Check `dtw_plots/` for cost matrices and paths.
- Outputs: CSVs in `model_res/` (e.g., `confusion_matrix.csv`).

Sample Output Table (from DTW comparisons):
```

| Word1     | Word2     | DTW Distance | Compression Points | Expansion Points |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Salam    | Salam    | 25.34       | 3                  | 2                |
| Salam    | Bale     | 67.89       | 5                  | 4                |
| BesiarAali | BesiarAali | 18.45     | 1                  | 1                |
```
## 📈 Results

- **Isolated Word Accuracy**: 85.2% (on 60 test samples across 6 words).
- **Per-Word Breakdown**:
  - Salam: 92% | Bale: 88% | Kheir: 80% | Motshakeram: 82% | BesiarAali: 85% | Khodahafez: 78%
- **Keyword Spotting Precision**: 70% (F1-score on 20 sentences, threshold=40).
- **Challenges**: Longer words (e.g., Motshakeram) show higher DTW distances due to variability.
